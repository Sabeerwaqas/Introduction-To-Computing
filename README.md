# 🌐 Introduction To Computing

Welcome to my new repo!

This space is dedicated to summarize the learning and outcomes from the YouTube series [Introduction To Programming](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLnd7R4Mcw3rLmfW78NJnXXaso1BNB9Kym&si=_cAvCGItLgeTUE6F) by Dr. Nouman. 

In this repo, I try to summarize whatever I learned from his lectures in my own words. Since, I decided to create this repo after watching some of his initial lectures. I am summarizing his lectures from **Lecture 07** to onwards.
