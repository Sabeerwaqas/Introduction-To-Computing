# Intro to Computing 07 - Library Functions, Variables, Intro to Errors

In this lecture, we introduced with the following:

* ```math``` library in Python.
* variables
* errors

## ```math``` library

He introduced us with ```math``` library of Python. In this library, we can import general math functions like ```sqrt()```, ```pow()``` etc. In Python, we can import math functions via following 2 approaches.

1. ```import math```

In the above approach, we requested Python to bring all the available maths function from the ```math``` library. Through this approach, we can call any available math function for our use like ```math.sqrt``` or ```math.pow``` etc. 

2. ```from math import sqrt```

In the above approach, we requested Python to bring only specific math funtion from library like ```sqrt```.
